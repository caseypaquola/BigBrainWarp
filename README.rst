BigBrain is a singular dataset that offers an ultra-high-resolution (20µm) volumetric reconstruction of a sliced and stained post-mortem human brain (Amunts et al. 2013). **BigBrainWarp** aims to enable integration of BigBrain with neuroimaging and other neurobiological modalities, helping a wide range of neuroscientists to utilise the cytoarchitectural information encoded in BigBrain for multi-scale neuroscientific discovery.


This repository includes:

- Preprocessed BigBrain features
- Simple scripts to transform between BigBrain and standard MRI spaces
- A selection of histology-derived feature maps already transformed to MRI space, and vice versa
- A series of tutorials that illustrate potential workflows for BigBrain-MRI integration

**See the preprint (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.04.442563v1) or readthedocs (https://bigbrainwarp.readthedocs.io/) for all your BigBrainWarp needs**
