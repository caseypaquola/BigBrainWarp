Naming conventions
********************************

In an effort to standardise and simplify the naming of files across BigBrainWarp, we have adopted the BIDS-like structure of `TemplateFlow https://www.templateflow.org/ <https://www.templateflow.org/>`_. This means that files likely have a different name than their source. The output of BigBrainWarp is automatically named according to this convention.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Indicator
     - Description
   * - tpl
     - Template of output data. Determined based on the required argument “out_space”.
   * - hemi
     - L for left, R for right. Only included in surface-based transformations where data is separated by hemisphere.  
   * - den
     - Density of output data on mesh. Currently only specified for fs_LR, where 164k and 32k options are possible. Can be indicated using the out_den parameter
   * - desc
     - General description of the data. Determined based on the required argument “desc”. In the “Datasets” table above, the desc is given in the first column. 


Data origins
********************************

BigBrainWarp depends upon collation of data from various sources. We’ll reference these sources throughout the documentation. Here is an overview of the data that was directly used in BigBrainWarp. In other words, this list encompasses data that was not generated specifically for BigBrainWarp.

Scripts
********************************

The bigbrainwarp function calls a range of scripts that may also be helpful for independent use:
